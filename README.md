# React-Web-Page-App
Web page built using React

This is my first (small) React project - building a simple web page providing information on some of the amazing places to visit in The Okanagan Valley, BC. The other two links are for display purposes only however I am visitng Vancouver, Vancouver Island, and Banff this summer so there's opportunity to build these pages in future.
